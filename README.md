Driver Drowsiness Detection using LSTM (Raspberry Pi Compatible)

This project uses an LSTM-based deep learning model to detect driver drowsiness in real time by analyzing facial features such as eye and mouth movements. The model runs on a Raspberry Pi and activates an alarm when signs of drowsiness are detected.

Features

- Real-time facial landmark detection using OpenCV and Dlib
- Eye aspect ratio (EAR) and mouth aspect ratio (MAR) based feature extraction
- LSTM model for time-series analysis of facial behavior
- Alarm system to alert the driver when drowsy behavior is detected
- Raspberry Pi compatible (`lstmmodelgpu.pth` file included)
